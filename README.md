# Simple-Data-visualization-to-show-smartphone-relations

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using multivariate visualization techniques applied to a smartphone dataset. The data, sourced from the Spanish website PC Componentes, provides a comprehensive collection of information on various smartphones, enabling a detailed analysis of their specifications and pricing. The dataset includes a wide range of smartphones from different brands, models, and configurations, making it a valuable resource for researchers, data analysts, and machine learning enthusiasts interested in the smartphone industry. The data was collected using Power Automate and is analyzed through various visual methods, including scatter plot matrices and trellis plots. The primary objectives of the analysis are to explore key variables such as RAM, storage capacity, and final price. The analysis uncovers significant relationships, such as a positive correlation between RAM/storage and final price, while showing no strong correlation between RAM and storage.
